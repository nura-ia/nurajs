# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to [security@nura.dev](mailto:security@nura.dev). Include reproduction steps, affected packages, and any logs that can help us diagnose the problem. We aim to acknowledge reports within two business days.

## Disclosure Process

- We coordinate fix timelines with the reporter.
- Public disclosure or proof-of-concept exploits should wait until a patched release is available.
- We credit reporters in release notes if they opt in.

## Supported Versions

We currently provide security fixes for the latest minor release of each `@nura-js/*` package. Older versions may receive fixes at the maintainers' discretion.
